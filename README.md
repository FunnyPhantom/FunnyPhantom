Hey.👋 

My name is Moha Movahedmanesh and I'm a software engineer.
I've co founded an startup, so I had to wore many hats, and most of them technical. So I have technical proficiency in a lot of places. (And the ability to quickly gain proficiency for a given tool.)
* For the Java stack I know Spring, Spring boot, and Reactor, lombok.
* For the Node.js stack I know NestJs, Express, mongoose, sequalize. I prefer typescript in node stack.
* For the Frontend stack I know React, Redux, Vue, Nuxt, Rebass, Emotion. I prefer typescript in Frontend. 
* I've recently started to integrate LLMs and Used python and fastAPI + pinecone db. (But my knowledge is shallow regarding this)
