Hey.üëã 

My name is Moha Movahedmanesh and I'm a software engineer. <br><br/> 
I've co founded an startup, so I had to wear many hats (most of them technical).  Thus I have technical proficiency in different stages of building a digital product + the ability to quickly gain proficiency in a new area and its tools. Here is a quick summary of some of my proficiencies:
* For the `Java` stack I know `Spring`, `Spring boot`, `Reactor`, and `Hibernate`. <br></br>
* For the `Node.js` stack I know `NestJs`, `Express`, `mongoose`, `sequalize`. I prefer `typescript` in node stack. <br></br>
* For the Frontend stack I know `React`, `Vue`, `Redux`, `Vuex`, `Nuxt`, `Rebass`, `React-query`, and more. I prefer `typescript` in Frontend. 
  * I have experience with advanced concepts and tools in depth, such as:
    *  SSR, SSG, Lazy loading, minification, dead-code elimination, responsive design, progressive enhancement, and more.
    *  `V8` engine, `Core-js`, `Webpack`, `rollup`, `yalc`, `metro`, `eslint`, and more.
  * JS ecosystem changes rapidly üòÖ, but I keep myself up-to-date with latest impactful technologies.<br></br>
* I've recently started to make LLMs based application. I used python and fastAPI + guidance + langchain + pinecone db. (But my knowledge is shallow regarding this) <br></br>
* I'am maintaining the [bebras platform](https://github.com/learn-python-ir) as part of [Algorithmic Creativity course](https://github.com/SharifiZarchi/Algorithmic_Creativity_Python_Programming_Highschool_Students) for highschool students, which helps them to discover the concepts of computer science for themselves, like how a scientist would. ^^ <br></br>
* I've contributed to open source projects such as [schemastore](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore), [guidance](https://github.com/guidance-ai/guidance), [vuetify](https://github.com/vuetifyjs/vuetify), etc. <br></br>
