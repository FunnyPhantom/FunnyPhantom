Hey.👋 

My name is Moha Movahedmanesh and I'm a software engineer. <br><br/> 
I've co founded an startup, so I had to wear many hats (most of them technical).  Thus I have technical proficiency in different stages of building a digital product + the ability to quickly gain proficiency in a new area and its tools. Here is a quick summary of some of my proficiencies:
* For the Java stack I know Spring, Spring boot, Reactor, and Hibernate.
* For the Node.js stack I know NestJs, Express, mongoose, sequalize. I prefer typescript in node stack.
* For the Frontend stack I know React, Vue, Redux, Vuex, Nuxt, Rebass, React-query, and more. I prefer typescript in Frontend.
  * Usually, the JS ecosystem changes rapidly 😅, but I keep myself up-to-date with latest impactful technologies.    
* I've recently started to make LLMs based application. I used python and fastAPI + guidance + langchain + pinecone db. (But my knowledge is shallow regarding this)
